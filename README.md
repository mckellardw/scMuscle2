# **scMuscle2:** single-cell muscle transcriptomics across species
In the scMuscle project, we attempted to gain a better understanding of the constituent cell types of murine skeletal muscle. In this update, we aim to expand the scope and resolution of that view, and to improve the availability of our analyses to the greater muscle/single-cell communities.

## TODO:

- Finish updating sample list, including new meta data (species, etc) [ ]
- Download fastqs [ ]
- Build reference genomes (w/ GENCODE)
  - Mouse [X]
  - Human [X]
  - ZF [ ]
- Run STARsolo [ ]
  - Add species selection step to STARsolo pipeline
- Single-cell analysis (seurat or scanpy?) [ ]
- Figure out multi-species integration (https://github.com/atarashansky/self-assembling-manifold) [ ]
