We further identify CD47 as a novel target for Tgfb1 regulation on monocytes/macrophages as CD47 activation leads to decreased expression of Tgfb1 in macrophages and systemic treatment with CD47 activating peptide results in attenuation of canonical TGFB1 signaling and HO. These findings elucidate the critical role of monocytes/macrophage subpopulations in aberrant wound healing and provide a novel therapeutic avenue.

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration. Overall design: Three replicates of each sample (iPax3 and iPax7 myogenic progenitors) were analyzed and compared to reference developmental samples embryonic and fetal myoblasts, and neonatal satellite cells (three rep each). Transcriptome profiling of iPax3/7 cells injected in vivo and re-isolated was then compared to adult satellite cells (3 reps each); finally, iPax3 cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-Seq and compared to single-cell RNA-Seq of adult satellite cells."

However, the full heterogenity of macrophages responding to injury has yet to be elucidated on the single-cell level. Furthermore, chronic inflammation may shift macrophage heterogeneity at steady-state and affect the generation of heterogeneity necessary for tissue repair. We use scRNA-sequencing to determine the heterogeneity of skeletal muscle macrophages during infection and wound repair (uninfected and infected). We identify multiple transcriptionally distinct macrophage subsets during injury in uninfected mice as well as during infection at steady-state. Interestingly, in response to injury, infected skeletal muscle macrophages fail to generate certain subsets of reparative macrophages in a timely fashion. Overall design: 8-12 week old C57BL/6 mice were orally infected with 5 ME49 T.gondii cysts and allowed to reach d24 post-infection to establish chronicity. Age and sex-matched uninfected and infected mice were given cardiotoxin naja pallida i.m. in one leg at 24 days post-infection. Contralateral leg was used as an uninjured control. Muscles were harvested at 4 days-post injury and prepared into a single cell suspension. Single cell suspensions were bulk sorted for macrophages by 7AAD-CD45+CD64+MerTK+ cells. Sorted cells from each group was individually assessed for and loaded onto the 10X Genomics Chromium platform for single-cell capture. cDNA libraries were constructed and subsequently sequenced on the Illumina platform.

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana™ miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish. Overall design: the scRNA-seq and bulk-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish"

Here, by leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 42,156 cells harvested from the site of implantation of either polycaprolactone or an extracellular-matrix-derived scaffold in a mouse model of volumetric muscle loss, we report a computational analysis of intercellular-signalling networks reconstructed from data of transcription-factor activation. We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells. In a Il17ra–/¬– knockout mouse model, we validated that predicted IL-17-linked transcriptional targets led to concomitant changes in gene expression.

Here, we show through detailed functional and single-cell genomic studies that intrinsic aging of bona fide mouse skeletal stem cells (SSCs) alters bone marrow niche signaling and skews bone and blood lineage differentiation leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Aged SSCs have diminished bone and cartilage forming potential but produce higher frequencies of stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell transcriptomic studies reveal a distinct population of SSCs in aged mice that gradually outcompete their younger counterparts in the bone marrow niche. While systemic exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis reduced local expression of inflammatory cytokines, it did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs and was insufficient to improve bone mass and skeletal-healing parameters in aged mice. Hematopoietic reconstitution of aged mice with young hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) also did not improve bone integrity and repair. We find that deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be reversed by the local application of a combinatorial treatment that re-activates aged SSCs and simultaneously abates crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu. This treatment expanded aged SSC pools, reduced osteoclast activity, and enhanced bone healing to youthful levels. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms underlying skeletal aging and offer new prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.

By isolating single cells from soft palate tissue of wild type embryos at E13.5, E14.5 and E15.5, we describe the heterogeneity of soft palate mesenchyme during development by analyzing single cell transcriptome. Combined analysis of bulk and single cell transcriptome of soft palate from wild type and Runx2 mutant suggests Runx2 activate expression of perimysial markers. Finally, we show that Runx2 activates expression of perimysial markers probably by repressing Twist1 through chromatin accessibility analysis. This study provides the first single cell level heterogeneity analysis of developing soft palate and shows the important role of Runx2 in regulating soft palate muscle development.

The current consensus is that myogenic cells originate from somites, while connective tissue fibroblasts originate from the lateral plate mesoderm. We challenged this model by cell and genetic lineage tracing experiments and identified that a subpopulation of limb myogenic cells did not originate from somite or Pax3 lineage, but rather originated from the lateral plate mesoderm and were derived from Osr1 and Scx lineages. Results: Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from limb cells at successive developmental stages identified a subpopulation of cells displaying a dual muscle and connective tissue signature, in addition to independent muscle and connective tissue populations. Active BMP signalling was detected in this junctional cell sub-population and at the tendon/muscle interface in developing limbs. BMP gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo and in vitro showed that this signalling pathway regulated a fibroblast-to-myoblast conversion. Conclusions: We propose that localised BMP signalling converts a subset of lateral plate mesoderm-derived fibroblasts to a myogenic fate and establishes a boundary of fibroblast-derived myonuclei at the tendon/muscle interface to control the muscle pattern during limb development and myotendinous formation.

Overall design: C57B6 mice received pre-operative treatment with 0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane inhalation. A 10 mm longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon was separated from surrounding tissue and dissected at it's midsection. For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37°C under constant agitation of 160rpm.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair.

Here, we used Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to directly address these limitations by performing the first systems genetics analysis of over 50 complex skeletal phenotypes. We applied a network approach to cortical bone RNA-seq data to discover 46 genes likely to be causal for human BMD GWAS associations, including the novel genes SERTAD4 and GLT8D2. We also performed GWAS in the DO for a wide-range of bone traits and identify Qsox1 as a novel gene influencing cortical bone accrual and bone strength. Our results provide a new perspective on the genetics of osteoporosis and highlight the ability of the mouse to inform human genetics. Overall design: Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on pooled polyA-selected total RNA from bone marrow-derived stromal cells, cultured from the femoral bone marrow of 5 Diversity Outbred mice (1 male, 4 females).

Strikingly, transplantation experiments indicated that these progenitors are also necessary for stem cell pool repopulation, implying that they are able to return to quiescence. Thus, we identified a critical role for NELF in the expansion of muscle progenitors in response to injury and revealed that progenitors returning to quiescence are major contributors to the stem cell pool repopulation. Overall design: RNA-seq performed on myogenic precursors which were isolated from regenerating skeletal muscle (mouse) at 5 days post-injury for wild type and NELF-B knockout populations."

CR attenuated aging-related changes in cell type composition, gene expression, and core transcriptional regulatory networks. Immune cells were increased during aging, and CR favorably reversed the aging-disturbed immune ecosystem. Computational prediction revealed that the abnormal cell-cell communication patterns observed during aging, including the excessive proinflammatory ligand-receptor interplay, were reversed by CR. Our work provides  multi-tissue single-cell transcriptional landscapes associated with aging and CR in a mammal, enhances our understanding of the robustness of CR as a geroprotective intervention, and uncovers how metabolic intervention can act upon the immune system to modify the process of aging.

Previous neuromuscular junction modeling efforts using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated either spinal cord neurons or skeletal muscles in monolayer culture. Here, we use hPSC-derived axial stem cells, the building blocks of the posterior body, to simultaneously generate spinal cord neurons and skeletal muscle cells that self-organize to generate human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) that can be maintained in 3D for several months. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids revealed reproducibility across experiments and enabled the tracking of the neural and mesodermal differentiation trajectories as organoids developed and matured. NMOs contain functional neuromuscular junctions supported by terminal Schwann cells. They contract and develop central pattern generator-like neuronal circuits. Finally, we successfully use NMOs to recapitulate key aspects of myasthenia gravis pathology, thus highlighting the significant potential of NMOs for modeling neuromuscular diseases in the future. Overall design: We have analyzed single cells from 10 organoids at Day 5. The organoids were separated in two samples (5 pooled organoids each) and labelled with different indexes. In total 5,135 cells were analyzed with a median of 3,333 genes per cell. For Day 50 we analyzed 4 organoids.

A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool.

We further identify CD47 as a novel target for Tgfb1 regulation on monocytes/macrophages as CD47 activation leads to decreased expression of Tgfb1 in macrophages and systemic treatment with CD47 activating peptide results in attenuation of canonical TGFB1 signaling and HO. These findings elucidate the critical role of monocytes/macrophage subpopulations in aberrant wound healing and provide a novel therapeutic avenue.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on macrophages sorted from either a biologic matrix [urinary bladder matrix (UBM)] or synthetic biomaterial [polycaprolactone (PCL)]. Implantation of UBM promotes tissue repair through generation of a tissue environment characterized by a T helper 2 (Th2)/interleukin (IL)–4 immune profile, whereas PCL induces a standard foreign body response characterized by Th17/IL-17 and fibrosis. Unbiased clustering and pseudotime analysis revealed distinct macrophage subsets responsible for antigen presentation, chemoattraction, and phagocytosis, as well as a small population with expression profiles of both dendritic cells and skeletal muscle after UBM implantation. In the PCL tissue environment, we identified a CD9 hi+ IL-36y + macrophage subset that expressed Th17-associated molecules. These macrophages were virtually absent in mice lacking the IL-17 receptor, suggesting that they might be involved in IL-17–dependent immune and autoimmune responses. Identification and comparison of the unique phenotypical and functional macrophage subsets in mouse and human tissue samples suggest broad relevance of the new classification. These distinct macrophage subsets demonstrate previously unrecognized myeloid phenotypes involved in different tissue responses and provide targets for potential therapeutic modulation in tissue repair and pathology. Overall design: Macrophages were sorted from mice quadriceps 1 week after undergoing volumetric muscle loss surgery with treatment of urinary bladder matrix, polycaprolactone, or saline. After sorting, cells were encapsulated using the 10x Chromium single cell RNA sequencing platform. Library prep followed the 10x 3' v2 protocol and were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Alignment was performed using 10x recommendations with the CellRanger software package to generate a counts matrix. Clusters of cells were determined using Seurat. In particular, data from the three conditions were pooled, normalized, and scaled. PCA was performed and used for clustering with a graph based method (shared nearest neighbor with the Louvaine method for community detection)."
