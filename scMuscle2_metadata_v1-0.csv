Here, we utilized in vivo and in vitro live imaging, CAS9/CRISPR-mediated mutagenesis in fish, genetic experiments in mice and single cell transcriptomics to demonstrate that individual myocyte polarization and subsequent orientation depend on cell stretch imposed by skeletal expansion. Our data revealed that upon migration, individual facial myocytes form unpolarized clusters corresponding to future muscle groups.

Experimental in vivo perturbations of cartilage shape, size and distribution caused disruptions in directionality and number of myofibrils.

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration. Overall design: Three replicates of each sample (iPax3 and iPax7 myogenic progenitors) were analyzed and compared to reference developmental samples embryonic and fetal myoblasts, and neonatal satellite cells (three rep each). Transcriptome profiling of iPax3/7 cells injected in vivo and re-isolated was then compared to adult satellite cells (3 reps each); finally, iPax3 cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-Seq and compared to single-cell RNA-Seq of adult satellite cells."

Here, we show through detailed functional and single-cell genomic studies that intrinsic aging of bona fide mouse skeletal stem cells (SSCs) alters bone marrow niche signaling and skews bone and blood lineage differentiation leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Aged SSCs have diminished bone and cartilage forming potential but produce higher frequencies of stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell transcriptomic studies reveal a distinct population of SSCs in aged mice that gradually outcompete their younger counterparts in the bone marrow niche. While systemic exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis reduced local expression of inflammatory cytokines, it did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs and was insufficient to improve bone mass and skeletal-healing parameters in aged mice. Hematopoietic reconstitution of aged mice with young hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) also did not improve bone integrity and repair. We find that deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be reversed by the local application of a combinatorial treatment that re-activates aged SSCs and simultaneously abates crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu. This treatment expanded aged SSC pools, reduced osteoclast activity, and enhanced bone healing to youthful levels. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms underlying skeletal aging and offer new prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.

We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells. In a Il17ra/ knockout mouse model, we validated that predicted IL-17-linked transcriptional targets led to concomitant changes in gene expression. Moreover, we identified cell subsets that had not been implicated in the responses to implanted biomaterials.

Single cell suspensions from whole tissue preparations were enriched for CD45+ cells to enable capture of less frequent cell populations and processed with Drop-seq. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to apply mesenchymal/fibroblasts (CD45-CD19-CD31-CD29+) to Drop-seq. Finally, a previously published data set of sorted macrophages (CD45+F4/80hi+Ly6c+CD64+) was included. Most samples collected were from young mice (6 week old at time of surgery) during the acute phase of injury one week after surgery. A detailed description of age, time of harvest, treatment, and sorting methodology for each of the samples in the atlas is provided in Supplementary Table 2. The resulting dataset includes 42,156 cells with an average of 198,000 reads and 1,167 genes per cell after filtering low-quality cells and genes across multiple time points and ages."

Here, by leveraging single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 42,156 cells harvested from the site of implantation of either polycaprolactone or an extracellular-matrix-derived scaffold in a mouse model of volumetric muscle loss, we report a computational analysis of intercellular-signalling networks reconstructed from data of transcription-factor activation. We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells. In a Il17ra/ knockout mouse model, we validated that predicted IL-17-linked transcriptional targets led to concomitant changes in gene expression. Moreover, we identified cell subsets that had not been implicated in the responses to implanted biomaterials. Single-cell atlases of the cellular responses to implanted biomaterials will facilitate the design of implantable biomaterials and the understanding of the ensuing cellular responses.

Here, we used Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to directly address these limitations by performing the first systems genetics analysis of over 50 complex skeletal phenotypes. We applied a network approach to cortical bone RNA-seq data to discover 46 genes likely to be causal for human BMD GWAS associations, including the novel genes SERTAD4 and GLT8D2. We also performed GWAS in the DO for a wide-range of bone traits and identify Qsox1 as a novel gene influencing cortical bone accrual and bone strength. Our results provide a new perspective on the genetics of osteoporosis and highlight the ability of the mouse to inform human genetics. Overall design: Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on pooled polyA-selected total RNA from bone marrow-derived stromal cells, cultured from the femoral bone marrow of 5 Diversity Outbred mice (1 male, 4 females). These data allowed us to profile the expression of novel bone-related genes in osteoblasts and bone marrow-derived stromal cells."

It is currently not clear what prevents vascular progenitors from responding to the adjacent signals that promote muscle development. An ETS transcription factor Etv2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vasculogenesis. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate.

It is currently not clear what prevents vascular progenitors from responding to the adjacent signals that promote muscle development. An ETS transcription factor Etv2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vasculogenesis. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate. We also identified the transcriptional signature of putative multipotent progenitors within the LPM that may give rise to vascular progenitor and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, we demonstrate that arterial progenitors co-express multiple arterial and venous markers during early stages of vasculogenesis, suggesting multi-potency of early vascular progenitors.These findings will be important in understanding the ontogeny of different mesodermal lineages and will help in designing in vitro differentiation strategies to generate vascular, muscle and other types of progenitors for therapeutic purposes.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair. Overall design: Freshly isolated neonatal dermal cells, neonatal dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days, adult dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days and freshly isolated adult hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. FR medium is 20 M F, 20 M R, 50 g/ml AA, and 50 ng/ml bFGF in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin."

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration. Overall design: Three replicates of each sample (iPax3 and iPax7 myogenic progenitors) were analyzed and compared to reference developmental samples embryonic and fetal myoblasts, and neonatal satellite cells (three rep each). Transcriptome profiling of iPax3/7 cells injected in vivo and re-isolated was then compared to adult satellite cells (3 reps each); finally, iPax3 cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-Seq and compared to single-cell RNA-Seq of adult satellite cells."

Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury. We derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in the vertebrate embryo. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the developmental trajectory of iPSCs-derived tenocytes.

Finally, we show that Runx2 activates expression of perimysial markers probably by repressing Twist1 through chromatin accessibility analysis. This study provides the first single cell level heterogeneity analysis of developing soft palate and shows the important role of Runx2 in regulating soft palate muscle development. Overall design: Transcriptome and chromatin accessiblity profiling of developing mouse soft palate"

For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37C under constant agitation of 160rpm. Digestions were subsequently quenched with 2% FBS in PBS and filtered through 40m sterile strainers. Cells were then washed in 2% FBS in PBS, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 1000-1200 cells/ul. Cell viability was assessed with Trypan blue exclusion on a Countess II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) automated counter and only samples with >85% viability were used for scRNA sequencing. Enough reagent was taken to sequence the transcriptome of 5000 cells according to 10x guidelines. 100,000 remaining cells were used for nuclei isolation according to the 10X Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell ATAC Sequencing protocol (available on their website)."

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRTPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish. Overall design: the scRNA-seq and bulk-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish"
