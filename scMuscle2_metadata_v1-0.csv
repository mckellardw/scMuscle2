Experimental in vivo perturbations of cartilage shape, size and distribution caused disruptions in directionality and number of myofibrils.

Although NELF is essential for embryonic development, its role in adult stem cells remains unclear. In this study, through a muscle-stem-cell-specific deletion, we showed that NELF is required for efficient muscle regeneration and stem cell pool replenishment. In mechanistic studies using PRO-seq, single-cell trajectory analyses and myofiber cultures revealed that NELF works at a specific stage of regeneration whereby it modulates p53 signaling to permit massive expansion of muscle progenitors. Strikingly, transplantation experiments indicated that these progenitors are also necessary for stem cell pool repopulation, implying that they are able to return to quiescence.

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration. Overall design: Three replicates of each sample (iPax3 and iPax7 myogenic progenitors) were analyzed and compared to reference developmental samples embryonic and fetal myoblasts, and neonatal satellite cells (three rep each). Transcriptome profiling of iPax3/7 cells injected in vivo and re-isolated was then compared to adult satellite cells (3 reps each); finally, iPax3 cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-Seq and compared to single-cell RNA-Seq of adult satellite cells."

Here, we show through detailed functional and single-cell genomic studies that intrinsic aging of bona fide mouse skeletal stem cells (SSCs) alters bone marrow niche signaling and skews bone and blood lineage differentiation leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Aged SSCs have diminished bone and cartilage forming potential but produce higher frequencies of stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell transcriptomic studies reveal a distinct population of SSCs in aged mice that gradually outcompete their younger counterparts in the bone marrow niche. While systemic exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis reduced local expression of inflammatory cytokines, it did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs and was insufficient to improve bone mass and skeletal-healing parameters in aged mice. Hematopoietic reconstitution of aged mice with young hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) also did not improve bone integrity and repair. We find that deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be reversed by the local application of a combinatorial treatment that re-activates aged SSCs and simultaneously abates crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu. This treatment expanded aged SSC pools, reduced osteoclast activity, and enhanced bone healing to youthful levels. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms underlying skeletal aging and offer new prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system. Overall design: 10X Genomics single cell RNA-sequencing of fracture calluses from 24-months old mice at day-10 after stabilized bi-cortical fracture induction. Fracture callus tissue was harvested from 24-mo mice at day-10 after injury. Three fracture calluses treated with hydrogels containing PBS at day of injury and three fractures with hydrogels containing anti-Csf1/BMP2  were processed, digested, and prepared for FACS as described above.

Here, we used Diversity Outbred (DO) mice to directly address these limitations by performing the first systems genetics analysis of over 50 complex skeletal phenotypes. We applied a network approach to cortical bone RNA-seq data to discover 46 genes likely to be causal for human BMD GWAS associations, including the novel genes SERTAD4 and GLT8D2. We also performed GWAS in the DO for a wide-range of bone traits and identify Qsox1 as a novel gene influencing cortical bone accrual and bone strength. Our results provide a new perspective on the genetics of osteoporosis and highlight the ability of the mouse to inform human genetics. Overall design: Here, we performed single-cell RNA-seq on pooled polyA-selected total RNA from bone marrow-derived stromal cells, cultured from the femoral bone marrow of 5 Diversity Outbred mice (1 male, 4 females). These data allowed us to profile the expression of novel bone-related genes in osteoblasts and bone marrow-derived stromal cells."

It is currently not clear what prevents vascular progenitors from responding to the adjacent signals that promote muscle development. An ETS transcription factor Etv2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vasculogenesis. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos.

It is currently not clear what prevents vascular progenitors from responding to the adjacent signals that promote muscle development. An ETS transcription factor Etv2 functions as an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of vasculogenesis. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair. Overall design: Freshly isolated neonatal dermal cells, neonatal dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days, adult dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days and freshly isolated adult hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. FR medium is 20 M F, 20 M R, 50 g/ml AA, and 50 ng/ml bFGF in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin."

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration. Overall design: Three replicates of each sample (iPax3 and iPax7 myogenic progenitors) were analyzed and compared to reference developmental samples embryonic and fetal myoblasts, and neonatal satellite cells (three rep each). Transcriptome profiling of iPax3/7 cells injected in vivo and re-isolated was then compared to adult satellite cells (3 reps each); finally, iPax3 cells were subjected to single-cell RNA-Seq and compared to single-cell RNA-Seq of adult satellite cells."

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury. We derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in the vertebrate embryo. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the developmental trajectory of iPSCs-derived tenocytes.

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRTPCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish. Overall design: the scRNA-seq and bulk-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish"
