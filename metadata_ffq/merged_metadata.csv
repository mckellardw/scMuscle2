Hindlimb development has historically been studied with lineage tracing of individual genes selected a priori, or at the bulk tissue level, which does not allow for the determination of single cell transcriptional programs yielding mature cell types and tissues. To identify the cellular trajectories of lineage specification during limb bud development, we used single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the developing murine hindlimb between embryonic days (E)11.5-E18.5. We found cell type heterogeneity at all time points, and the expected cell types that form the mouse hindlimb. In addition, we used RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the spatial locations of cell types and cell trajectories to understand the ancestral continuum of cell maturation.

A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal.

A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair. Overall design: Freshly isolated neonatal dermal cells, neonatal dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days, adult dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days and freshly isolated adult hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing.

Here we show that R DMDdel52 animals recapitulated human DMD pathophysiological trajectory more faithfully than the mdx mouse model. We report that R DMDdel52 rats displayed progressive and severe skeletal muscle loss associated with fibrotic deposition, fat infiltration and fibre type switch.

Conditional expression of Pax3/Pax7 in differentiating pluripotent stem cells (PSC) allows the generation of myogenic progenitors endowed with satellite cell-like abilities.  To identify the molecular determinants underlying their regenerative potential, we performed transcriptome analyses of these cells along with primary myogenic cells from several developmental stages. Here we show that in vitro generated PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess a molecular signature similar to embryonic/fetal myoblasts. However, compared to fetal myoblasts, following transplantation they show superior myofiber engraftment and ability to seed the satellite cell niche, respond to multiple re-injuries and contribute to long-term regeneration. Upon engraftment, the transcriptome of Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors changes dramatically, acquiring similarity to that of satellite cells, particularly in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. Single cell profiling reveals that these changes are induced, not selected, by the in vivo environment.  These findings demonstrate that Pax3/Pax7-induced PSC-derived myogenic progenitors possess proliferative and migratory abilities characteristic of earlier developmental stages, and an intrinsic ability to respond to environmental cues upon skeletal muscle regeneration.

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury. We derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in the vertebrate embryo.

In the musculoskeletal system, the attachment of elastic tendons to stiff bones poses a mechanical challenge that is solved by the formation of a transitional tissue, which allows the transfer of muscle forces to the skeleton without tearing. Here, we show that tendon-to-bone attachment cells are bi-fated, activating a mixture of  chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, which is regulated by sharing regulatory elements with these cells and by KrÃ¼ppel-like factors transcription factors (KLF).  To uncover the molecular identity of attachment cells, we first applied high-throughput bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to murine humeral attachment cells. The results, which were validated by in situ and single-molecule in situ hybridization, reveal that together with the expression of unique sets of genes, the attachment cells express hundreds of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes. In search for the underlying mechanism, we performed ATAC sequencing and found that attachment cells share a significant fraction of accessible intergenic chromatin areas with either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Epigenomic analysis further revealed transcriptional enhancer signatures for the majority of these regions. We then examined a subset of these regions using transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assay. Results verified the shared activity of some of these enhancers, supporting the possibility that the transcriptome of attachment cells is regulated by enhancers with shared activities in tenocytes or chondrocytes. Finally, integrative chromatin and motif analyses, as well as the transcriptome data, indicated that KLFs are regulators of attachment cells. Indeed, blocking the expression of Klf2 and Klf4 in the developing limb mesenchyme led to abnormal differentiation of attachment cells, establishing these factors as key regulators of the fate of these cells. In summary, our findings show how the molecular identity of bi-fated attachment cells enables the formation of the unique transitional tissue that connects tendon to bone. More broadly, we show how mixing the transcriptomes of two cell types through shared enhancers and a dedicated set of transcription factors can lead to the formation of a new cell fate that connects them.

The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37°C under constant agitation of 160rpm. Digestions were subsequently quenched with 2% FBS in PBS and filtered through 40µm sterile strainers. Cells were then washed in 2% FBS in PBS, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 1000-1200 cells/ul. Cell viability was assessed with Trypan blue exclusion on a Countess II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) automated counter and only samples with >85% viability were used for scRNA sequencing. Enough reagent was taken to sequence the transcriptome of 5000 cells according to 10x guidelines. 100,000 remaining cells were used for nuclei isolation according to the 10X Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell ATAC Sequencing protocol (available on their website).",SRS7895117,BTS_D7_1,Mus musculus,Day 7 post Burn/Tenotomy with sham neurectomy injury site,,,,,,,2021-05-02,2021-05-02,"[{'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR132/075/SRR13268675/SRR13268675_1.fastq.gz', 'md5': '68e9af2ea06fd983dc9a5683b4f7cf6d', 'size': '8812254038'}, {'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR132/075/SRR13268675/SRR13268675_2.fastq.gz', 'md5': 'ab9db16ca564cec4000382c70ef0fc73', 'size': '7868222739'}]",C57B6,,tendon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,tendon injury site

Overall design: C57B6 mice received pre-operative treatment with 0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane inhalation. A 10 mm longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon was separated from surrounding tissue and dissected at it's midsection. For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury.

The current consensus is that myogenic cells originate from somites, while connective tissue fibroblasts originate from the lateral plate mesoderm. We challenged this model by cell and genetic lineage tracing experiments and identified that a subpopulation of limb myogenic cells did not originate from somite or Pax3 lineage, but rather originated from the lateral plate mesoderm and were derived from Osr1 and Scx lineages. Results: Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from limb cells at successive developmental stages identified a subpopulation of cells displaying a dual muscle and connective tissue signature, in addition to independent muscle and connective tissue populations. Active BMP signalling was detected in this junctional cell sub-population and at the tendon/muscle interface in developing limbs. BMP gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo and in vitro showed that this signalling pathway regulated a fibroblast-to-myoblast conversion. Conclusions: We propose that localised BMP signalling converts a subset of lateral plate mesoderm-derived fibroblasts to a myogenic fate and establishes a boundary of fibroblast-derived myonuclei at the tendon/muscle interface to control the muscle pattern during limb development and myotendinous formation.
