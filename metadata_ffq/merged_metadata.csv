Using computational approaches, we could reconstruct dynamic trajectories and place, in a pseudotemporal manner, the transcriptomes of individual MuSC within these trajectories. This approach allowed for the identification of distinct clusters of MuSCs and primary myoblasts with partially overlapping but distinct transcriptional signatures, as well as the description of metabolic pathways associated with defined MuSC states.

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana™ miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish.

The current consensus is that myogenic cells originate from somites, while connective tissue fibroblasts originate from the lateral plate mesoderm. We challenged this model by cell and genetic lineage tracing experiments and identified that a subpopulation of limb myogenic cells did not originate from somite or Pax3 lineage, but rather originated from the lateral plate mesoderm and were derived from Osr1 and Scx lineages. Results: Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from limb cells at successive developmental stages identified a subpopulation of cells displaying a dual muscle and connective tissue signature, in addition to independent muscle and connective tissue populations. Active BMP signalling was detected in this junctional cell sub-population and at the tendon/muscle interface in developing limbs. BMP gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo and in vitro showed that this signalling pathway regulated a fibroblast-to-myoblast conversion. Conclusions: We propose that localised BMP signalling converts a subset of lateral plate mesoderm-derived fibroblasts to a myogenic fate and establishes a boundary of fibroblast-derived myonuclei at the tendon/muscle interface to control the muscle pattern during limb development and myotendinous formation.

Within skeletal muscle, blood vessels (endothelium) lie in parallel with muscle fibers. What is less well described is whether the functional properties of muscle ECs (mECs) are dependent on the specific fiber (and thus microenvironment) they interact with. Furthermore, the mechanisms of exercise-induced vascular expansion however are poorly understood.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice.

By snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq, we showed that slow, fast, myotendinous and neuromuscular junction myonuclei each have different transcriptional programs, associated with distinct chromatin states and combinations of transcription factors. In adult mice, identified myofiber types predominantly express either a slow or one of the three fast isoforms of Myosin heavy chain (MYH) proteins, while a small number of hybrid fibers can express more than one MYH. By snRNA-seq and FISH, we showed that the majority of myonuclei within a myofiber are synchronized, coordinately expressing only one fast Myh isoform with a preferential pane of muscle-specific genes.

Previous neuromuscular junction modeling efforts using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated either spinal cord neurons or skeletal muscles in monolayer culture. Here, we use hPSC-derived axial stem cells, the building blocks of the posterior body, to simultaneously generate spinal cord neurons and skeletal muscle cells that self-organize to generate human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) that can be maintained in 3D for several months. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids revealed reproducibility across experiments and enabled the tracking of the neural and mesodermal differentiation trajectories as organoids developed and matured. NMOs contain functional neuromuscular junctions supported by terminal Schwann cells. They contract and develop central pattern generator-like neuronal circuits. Finally, we successfully use NMOs to recapitulate key aspects of myasthenia gravis pathology, thus highlighting the significant potential of NMOs for modeling neuromuscular diseases in the future. Overall design: We have analyzed single cells from 10 organoids at Day 5. The organoids were separated in two samples (5 pooled organoids each) and labelled with different indexes. In total 5,135 cells were analyzed with a median of 3,333 genes per cell. For Day 50 we analyzed 4 organoids.

Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate. We also identified the transcriptional signature of putative multipotent progenitors within the LPM that may give rise to vascular progenitor and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, we demonstrate that arterial progenitors co-express multiple arterial and venous markers during early stages of vasculogenesis, suggesting multi-potency of early vascular progenitors.These findings will be important in understanding the ontogeny of different mesodermal lineages and will help in designing in vitro differentiation strategies to generate vascular, muscle and other types of progenitors for therapeutic purposes.

Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate. We also identified the transcriptional signature of putative multipotent progenitors within the LPM that may give rise to vascular progenitor and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, we demonstrate that arterial progenitors co-express multiple arterial and venous markers during early stages of vasculogenesis, suggesting multi-potency of early vascular progenitors.These findings will be important in understanding the ontogeny of different mesodermal lineages and will help in designing in vitro differentiation strategies to generate vascular, muscle and other types of progenitors for therapeutic purposes.

Hindlimb development has historically been studied with lineage tracing of individual genes selected a priori, or at the bulk tissue level, which does not allow for the determination of single cell transcriptional programs yielding mature cell types and tissues. To identify the cellular trajectories of lineage specification during limb bud development, we used single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the developing murine hindlimb between embryonic days (E)11.5-E18.5. We found cell type heterogeneity at all time points, and the expected cell types that form the mouse hindlimb. In addition, we used RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to examine the spatial locations of cell types and cell trajectories to understand the ancestral continuum of cell maturation.

Mechanotherapy in the form of cyclic compressive loading has been shown to benefit skeletal muscle under a variety of paradigms, but not during the recovery from disuse in aged muscle. To determine whether mechanotherapy promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, a critical aspect of muscle recovery after atrophy, we performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of gastrocnemius muscle cell populations, stable isotope tracing of intramuscular collagen, and histology of the ECM in adult and aged rats recovering from disuse, with and without mechanotherapy. ECM remodeling-related gene expression in fibro-adipose progenitor cells (FAPs) was absent in aged compared to adult muscle following 7 days of recovery, and instead were enriched in chemoattractant genes. There was a significantly lower expression of genes related to phagocytic activity in aged macrophages during recovery, despite enriched chemokine gene expression of numerous stromal cell populations, including FAPs and endothelial cells. Mechanotherapy reprogrammed the transcriptomes of both FAPs and macrophages in aged muscle recovering from disuse to restore ECM-and phagocytosis-related gene expression, respectively. Stable isotope labeling of intramuscular collagen and histological evaluation confirmed mechanotherapy-mediated remodeling of the ECM in aged muscle recovering from disuse.

To bridge the gap between preclinical and therapeutic evaluation studies, we have generated a rat model for DMD that carries an exon 52 deletion (R DMDdel52) causing a complete lack of dystrophin protein. Here we show that R DMDdel52 animals recapitulated human DMD pathophysiological trajectory more faithfully than the mdx mouse model. We report that R DMDdel52 rats displayed progressive and severe skeletal muscle loss associated with fibrotic deposition, fat infiltration and fibre type switch. Early fibrosis was also apparent in the cardiac muscle. These histological modifications led to severe muscle, respiratory and cardiac functional impairments leading to premature death around one year. Moreover, DMD muscle exhibited systemic inflammation with a mixed M1/M2 phenotype. A comparative single cell RNAseq analysis of the diaphragm muscle was performed, revealing cellular populations alteration and molecular modifications in all muscle cell types. We show that DMD fibroadipogenic progenitors produced elevated levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a glycoprotein responsible for modulating homeostasis of extracellular matrix, and whose increased concentration correlated with muscle fibrosis both in R DMDdel52 rats and human patients. Fibrosis is a component of tissue remodelling impacting the whole musculature of DMD patients, at the tissue level but most importantly at the functional level. We therefore propose that this specific biomarker can optimize the prognostic monitoring of functional improvement of patients included in clinical trials.

FN-RMS resemble early muscle found in embryonic and larval development, while fusion-positive (FP-)RMS express a highly specific developmental gene program found in muscle cells transiting from embryonic to fetal development at 7-7.75 weeks of age.  FP-RMS also have neural-pathway enriched cell states, suggesting less-rigid adherence to muscle development hierarchies in this disease.  Finally, we identify a molecularly-defined tumor-propagating cell in FN-RMS that shares remarkable similarity to the newly described bi-potent, muscle mesenchyme stem/progenitor cell that makes both muscle and osteogenic cells.

We previously reported on direct conversion of mouse fibroblasts into induced myogenic progenitor cells (iMPCs) by means of transient MyoD overexpression in concert with small molecules treatment. Here we employed integrative multi-omic assays to delineate the molecular landscape of fibroblast reprogramming into iMPCs in comparison to transdifferentiation into myogenic cells solely by MyoD overexpression. Utilizing bulk RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry we characterized molecular regulators and pathways that endow a myogenic stem cell identity on fibroblasts only in the presence of small molecule treatment. We further demonstrate that iMPC reprogramming is a stepwise process, commencing with the appearance of myofibers and committed myogenic progenitors prior to the formation of satellite cell-like myogenic progenitors that express a suite of stem cell markers including Pax7, Dek, Myf5, Sox8, and Dmrt2. To directly compare iMPCs to satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts, we employed a fluorescent Pax7-GFP reporter to purify Pax7+ cells from the heterogenous iMPC cultures and assess their equivalency to FACS-purified Pax7-GFP+ myoblasts. We demonstrate that Pax7+ iMPCs share molecular attributes with myoblasts, however also express genes and signaling pathways that are indicative of activated satellite cells including Carm1, Dlk1, Lgr5, Fos, Dek, Calcr and Pitx3. We further establish that iMPC formation and maintenance is dependent on the Notch pathway, as small molecule inhibition of Notch abrogates iMPC formation and derails stable iMPC cultures via depletion of Pax7 expressing cells. Lastly, using single cell RNA-sequencing we determine the cell populations that comprise iMPCs in addition to reconstructing the differentiation trajectory present in these heterogenous cultures. We demonstrate that a highly proliferative activated satellite cell-like population differentiates into committed myoblasts and myocytes that further give rise to myofibers that express mature muscle markers, thus capturing a dynamic differentiation program in vitro.

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana™ miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data.

How robust muscle tendon junctions (MTJs) form to be able to withstand contraction forces is still not understood. Using techniques at a single cell resolution we reexamined the classical view of distinct identities for the tissues composing the musculoskeletal system. We identified fibroblasts that have switched on a myogenic program and demonstrate these dual identity cells fuse into the developing muscle fibers along the MTJs facilitating the introduction of fibroblast-specific transcripts into the elongating myofibers. We suggest this mechanism resulting in a hybrid muscle fiber, primarily along the fiber tips, enables a smooth transition from muscle fiber characteristics towards tendon features essential for forming robust MTJs.

In the musculoskeletal system, the attachment of elastic tendons to stiff bones poses a mechanical challenge that is solved by the formation of a transitional tissue, which allows the transfer of muscle forces to the skeleton without tearing. Here, we show that tendon-to-bone attachment cells are bi-fated, activating a mixture of  chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, which is regulated by sharing regulatory elements with these cells and by KrÃ¼ppel-like factors transcription factors (KLF).  To uncover the molecular identity of attachment cells, we first applied high-throughput bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to murine humeral attachment cells. The results, which were validated by in situ and single-molecule in situ hybridization, reveal that together with the expression of unique sets of genes, the attachment cells express hundreds of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes. In search for the underlying mechanism, we performed ATAC sequencing and found that attachment cells share a significant fraction of accessible intergenic chromatin areas with either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Epigenomic analysis further revealed transcriptional enhancer signatures for the majority of these regions. We then examined a subset of these regions using transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assay. Results verified the shared activity of some of these enhancers, supporting the possibility that the transcriptome of attachment cells is regulated by enhancers with shared activities in tenocytes or chondrocytes. Finally, integrative chromatin and motif analyses, as well as the transcriptome data, indicated that KLFs are regulators of attachment cells. Indeed, blocking the expression of Klf2 and Klf4 in the developing limb mesenchyme led to abnormal differentiation of attachment cells, establishing these factors as key regulators of the fate of these cells. In summary, our findings show how the molecular identity of bi-fated attachment cells enables the formation of the unique transitional tissue that connects tendon to bone. More broadly, we show how mixing the transcriptomes of two cell types through shared enhancers and a dedicated set of transcription factors can lead to the formation of a new cell fate that connects them.
