We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on macrophages sorted from either a biologic matrix [urinary bladder matrix (UBM)] or synthetic biomaterial [polycaprolactone (PCL)]. Implantation of UBM promotes tissue repair through generation of a tissue environment characterized by a T helper 2 (Th2)/interleukin (IL)–4 immune profile, whereas PCL induces a standard foreign body response characterized by Th17/IL-17 and fibrosis. Unbiased clustering and pseudotime analysis revealed distinct macrophage subsets responsible for antigen presentation, chemoattraction, and phagocytosis, as well as a small population with expression profiles of both dendritic cells and skeletal muscle after UBM implantation.

Here, we describe the creation of a new mouse model of DMD caused by deletion of exon 51 of the dystrophin gene, which represents a prevalent mutation in humans. To understand the transcriptional abnormalities and heterogeneity associated with the nuclei of myofibers, as well as other mononucleated cell types that contribute to DMD disease pathogenesis, we performed single nucleus transcriptomics of skeletal muscle of mice with exon 51 deletion. Our results reveal distinctive and previously unrecognized myonuclear subtypes within dystrophic myofibers and uncover degenerative and regenerative transcriptional pathways underlying DMD pathogenesis. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of DMD, controlled by the transcriptional activity of different types of muscle and nonmuscle nuclei.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair. Overall design: Freshly isolated neonatal dermal cells, neonatal dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days, adult dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days and freshly isolated adult hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. FR medium is 20 µM F, 20 µM R, 50 µg/ml AA, and 50 ng/ml bFGF in high-glucose DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.",SRS7442445,Hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells,Mus musculus,Adult hindlimb muscle,C57BL/6,,,,194578885,23154887315,2020-09-29,2020-09-29,"[{'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR127/071/SRR12734271/SRR12734271_1.fastq.gz', 'md5': '3ac1358a7e4fcb64b71315f4dbbab0fe', 'size': '3645927796'}, {'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR127/071/SRR12734271/SRR12734271_2.fastq.gz', 'md5': '009f5f058ee38be4d886f681f70890b1', 'size': '8677204234'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury. We derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in the vertebrate embryo. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the developmental trajectory of iPSCs-derived tenocytes.

In the musculoskeletal system, the attachment of elastic tendons to stiff bones poses a mechanical challenge that is solved by the formation of a transitional tissue, which allows the transfer of muscle forces to the skeleton without tearing. Here, we show that tendon-to-bone attachment cells are bi-fated, activating a mixture of  chondrocyte and tenocyte transcriptomes, which is regulated by sharing regulatory elements with these cells and by KrÃ¼ppel-like factors transcription factors (KLF).  To uncover the molecular identity of attachment cells, we first applied high-throughput bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing to murine humeral attachment cells. The results, which were validated by in situ and single-molecule in situ hybridization, reveal that together with the expression of unique sets of genes, the attachment cells express hundreds of chondrogenic and tenogenic genes. In search for the underlying mechanism, we performed ATAC sequencing and found that attachment cells share a significant fraction of accessible intergenic chromatin areas with either tenocytes or chondrocytes. Epigenomic analysis further revealed transcriptional enhancer signatures for the majority of these regions. We then examined a subset of these regions using transgenic mouse enhancer reporter assay. Results verified the shared activity of some of these enhancers, supporting the possibility that the transcriptome of attachment cells is regulated by enhancers with shared activities in tenocytes or chondrocytes. Finally, integrative chromatin and motif analyses, as well as the transcriptome data, indicated that KLFs are regulators of attachment cells. Indeed, blocking the expression of Klf2 and Klf4 in the developing limb mesenchyme led to abnormal differentiation of attachment cells, establishing these factors as key regulators of the fate of these cells. In summary, our findings show how the molecular identity of bi-fated attachment cells enables the formation of the unique transitional tissue that connects tendon to bone. More broadly, we show how mixing the transcriptomes of two cell types through shared enhancers and a dedicated set of transcription factors can lead to the formation of a new cell fate that connects them.

Overall design: C57B6 mice received pre-operative treatment with 0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane inhalation. A 10 mm longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon was separated from surrounding tissue and dissected at it's midsection. For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37°C under constant agitation of 160rpm. Digestions were subsequently quenched with 2% FBS in PBS and filtered through 40µm sterile strainers.
