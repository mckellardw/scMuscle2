Previous neuromuscular junction modeling efforts using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated either spinal cord neurons or skeletal muscles in monolayer culture. Here, we use hPSC-derived axial stem cells, the building blocks of the posterior body, to simultaneously generate spinal cord neurons and skeletal muscle cells that self-organize to generate human neuromuscular organoids (NMOs) that can be maintained in 3D for several months. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of individual organoids revealed reproducibility across experiments and enabled the tracking of the neural and mesodermal differentiation trajectories as organoids developed and matured. NMOs contain functional neuromuscular junctions supported by terminal Schwann cells. They contract and develop central pattern generator-like neuronal circuits. Finally, we successfully use NMOs to recapitulate key aspects of myasthenia gravis pathology, thus highlighting the significant potential of NMOs for modeling neuromuscular diseases in the future. Overall design: We have analyzed single cells from 10 organoids at Day 5. The organoids were separated in two samples (5 pooled organoids each) and labelled with different indexes. In total 5,135 cells were analyzed with a median of 3,333 genes per cell. For Day 50 we analyzed 4 organoids.

To better understand RMS, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of one embryonal subtype RMS (ERMS) and one alveolar subtype RMS (ARMS). We expanded our observations by performing single-nucleus RNA-seq of 18 patient tumors (12 ERMS, 6 ARMS). All 18 of these tumors were used to generate orthotopic patient-derived xenografts, and we performed single-cell RNA-seq of all 18 O-PDXs to compare heterogeneity between the original tumor and the patient-derived model. 15 of the O-PDXs underwent lentiviral barcoding, and lineage could be tracked using a separate dial-out PCR step during the single-cell RNA-seq workflow. We performed single-cell RNA-seq of an ex vivo organoid, showing that we can preserve heterogeneity in this model. We expanded our study to the epigenetic level by using single-cell ATAC-sequencing of 7 O-PDXs. Finally, we longitudinally tracked shifts in heterogeneity in an O-PDX model treated with chemotherapy. Overall design: We performed single-cell RNA-seq from 2 patient RMS tumors, 18 O-PDXs, and 1 organoid. Additionally, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq from 18 patient RMS tumors and single-cell ATAC-seq from 7 O-PDXs.

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury. We derived tenocytes from human iPSCs by recapitulating the normal progression of step-wise narrowing fate decisions in the vertebrate embryo. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the developmental trajectory of iPSCs-derived tenocytes.

Overall design: C57B6 mice received pre-operative treatment with 0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane inhalation. A 10 mm longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon was separated from surrounding tissue and dissected at it's midsection. For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37°C under constant agitation of 160rpm. Digestions were subsequently quenched with 2% FBS in PBS and filtered through 40µm sterile strainers. Cells were then washed in 2% FBS in PBS, counted and resuspended at a concentration of 1000-1200 cells/ul. Cell viability was assessed with Trypan blue exclusion on a Countess II (Thermo Fisher Scientific) automated counter and only samples with >85% viability were used for scRNA sequencing.
