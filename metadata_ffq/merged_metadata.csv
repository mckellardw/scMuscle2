Overall design: Three subpopulations of satellite cells (Pax7Hi, Pax7Mi and Pax7Lo) were isolated by FACS based on levels of GFP (Pax7) from tibialis anterior muscle of Pax7-nGFP transgenic mice and subjected to single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq).",SRS5122664,Pax7Hi,Mus musculus,Satellite cells,C57BL6:SJL/J,tibialis anterior muscle,3 month,Pax7Hi,458443291,137532987300,2019-09-06,2019-09-06,Illumina NovaSeq 6000 paired end sequencing; GSM3955372: Pax7Hi; Mus musculus; RNA-Seq,"[{'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR971/008/SRR9715808/SRR9715808_1.fastq.gz', 'md5': 'bb21c34258c2729547f0d85fd9b016d8', 'size': '10067019778'}, {'url': 'ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR971/008/SRR9715808/SRR9715808_2.fastq.gz', 'md5': '28dd4a083016d1af63ea1c434ac9716f', 'size': '10027226405'}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana™ miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish.

Here, we show through detailed functional and single-cell genomic studies that intrinsic aging of bona fide mouse skeletal stem cells (SSCs) alters bone marrow niche signaling and skews bone and blood lineage differentiation leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Aged SSCs have diminished bone and cartilage forming potential but produce higher frequencies of stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell transcriptomic studies reveal a distinct population of SSCs in aged mice that gradually outcompete their younger counterparts in the bone marrow niche. While systemic exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis reduced local expression of inflammatory cytokines, it did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs and was insufficient to improve bone mass and skeletal-healing parameters in aged mice. Hematopoietic reconstitution of aged mice with young hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) also did not improve bone integrity and repair. We find that deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be reversed by the local application of a combinatorial treatment that re-activates aged SSCs and simultaneously abates crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice.

Together, our data reveal that activin A is a critical upstream signaling stimulator of HO in mice and could represent an effective therapeutic target against acquired forms of this pathology in patients.
