Overall design: 8-12 week old C57BL/6 mice were orally infected with 5 ME49 T.gondii cysts and allowed to reach d24 post-infection to establish chronicity. Age and sex-matched uninfected and infected mice were given cardiotoxin naja pallida i.m. in one leg at 24 days post-infection. Contralateral leg was used as an uninjured control. Muscles were harvested at 4 days-post injury and prepared into a single cell suspension. Single cell suspensions were bulk sorted for macrophages by 7AAD-CD45+CD64+MerTK+ cells.

However, the full heterogenity of macrophages responding to injury has yet to be elucidated on the single-cell level. Furthermore, chronic inflammation may shift macrophage heterogeneity at steady-state and affect the generation of heterogeneity necessary for tissue repair. We use scRNA-sequencing to determine the heterogeneity of skeletal muscle macrophages during infection and wound repair (uninfected and infected).

We could reliably find injury and activated SC as judged by side and forward scatter. We FACS isolated cells from both days separately and spiked in 20% of the ECs into the SCs, and performed single cell RNA-seq for each time point. We performed extensive sequencing averaging more than 300K read/cell. We were able to align the data and overlap the basal and injured cells and able to deconvolve the quiescent SCs from the activated and more differentiated MuSCs, ECs  and contaminating cell types from gene signatures. Overall design: Cells for single cell sequencing were obtained from Pax7tdT:Flk1GFP mice hind limb muscles following enzymatic digestion as previously described (Liu et al., 2015).

We could reliably find injury and activated SC as judged by side and forward scatter. We FACS isolated cells from both days separately and spiked in 20% of the ECs into the SCs, and performed single cell RNA-seq for each time point. We performed extensive sequencing averaging more than 300K read/cell. We were able to align the data and overlap the basal and injured cells and able to deconvolve the quiescent SCs from the activated and more differentiated MuSCs, ECs  and contaminating cell types from gene signatures. Overall design: Cells for single cell sequencing were obtained from Pax7tdT:Flk1GFP mice hind limb muscles following enzymatic digestion as previously described (Liu et al., 2015).

One advantage of multinucleation can be the assignment of distinct functions to different nuclei, but comprehensive interrogation of transcriptional heterogeneity within multinucleated tissues has been challenging due to the presence of a shared cytoplasm. Here, we utilized single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to determine the extent of transcriptional diversity within multinucleated skeletal myofibers. Nuclei from mouse skeletal muscle were profiled across the lifespan, which revealed the emergence of distinct myonuclear populations in postnatal development and their reactivation in aging muscle. Our datasets also provided a platform for discovery of novel genes associated with rare specialized regions of the muscle cell, including markers of the myotendinous junction and functionally validated factors expressed at the neuromuscular junction. These findings reveal that myonuclei within syncytial muscle fibers possess distinct transcriptional profiles that regulate muscle biology.

A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool.

A major roadblock to understanding satellite cell fate decisions has been the difficulty to study this process in vivo. By visualizing expression dynamics of myogenic transcription factors during early regeneration in vivo, we identified the time point at which cells undergo decisions to differentiate or self-renew. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heterogeneity of satellite cells during both muscle homeostasis and regeneration, including a subpopulation enriched in Notch2 receptor expression. Furthermore, we reveal that differentiating cells express the Dll1 ligand. Using antagonistic antibodies we demonstrate that the DLL1 and NOTCH2 signaling pair is required for satellite cell self-renewal. Thus, differentiating cells provide the self-renewing signal during regeneration, enabling proportional regeneration in response to injury while maintaining the satellite cell pool. These findings have implications for therapeutic control of muscle regeneration.

We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate. We also identified the transcriptional signature of putative multipotent progenitors within the LPM that may give rise to vascular progenitor and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, we demonstrate that arterial progenitors co-express multiple arterial and venous markers during early stages of vasculogenesis, suggesting multi-potency of early vascular progenitors.These findings will be important in understanding the ontogeny of different mesodermal lineages and will help in designing in vitro differentiation strategies to generate vascular, muscle and other types of progenitors for therapeutic purposes.

Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of hematovascular development in wild-type and etv2 mutant zebrafish embryos. Distinct transcriptional signatures of different types of hematopoietic and vascular progenitors were identified using an etv2ci32Gt gene trap line, in which Gal4 transcriptional activator has integrated into the etv2 gene locus. Unexpectedly, a cell population with the skeletal muscle signature was observed in etv2-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that multiple etv2ci32Gt; UAS:GFP cells migrate into the somites, elongate and differentiate as skeletal muscle cells instead of contributing to vasculature in etv2-deficient embryos. Wnt and FGF signaling promoted the differentiation of these putative multipotent etv2 progenitor cells into skeletal muscle cells. We conclude that etv2 actively represses muscle differentiation in vascular progenitors, thus locking these cells into vascular endothelial fate. We also identified the transcriptional signature of putative multipotent progenitors within the LPM that may give rise to vascular progenitor and skeletal muscle cells. Finally, we demonstrate that arterial progenitors co-express multiple arterial and venous markers during early stages of vasculogenesis, suggesting multi-potency of early vascular progenitors.These findings will be important in understanding the ontogeny of different mesodermal lineages and will help in designing in vitro differentiation strategies to generate vascular, muscle and other types of progenitors for therapeutic purposes.

Whether tip cells require differential signals to develop their complex branching patterns remained unknown. Here we show that diving tip cells invading the neuroretina (D-tip cells) are distinct from tip cells guiding the superficial retinal vascular plexus (S-tip cells). D-tip cells have a unique transcriptional signature, including high TGFß signaling, and acquire blood-retina barrier properties. Endothelial deletion of TGFß receptor I (Alk5) inhibits D-tip cell identity acquisition and deep vascular plexus formation. Loss of endothelial ALK5, but not of the canonical SMAD effectors, leads to aberrant contractile pericyte differentiation, and hemorrhagic vascular malformations. Our data reveal stage-specific tip cell heterogeneity as a requirement for retinal vascular development and suggest that noncanonical-TGFß signaling could improve retinal revascularization and neural function in ischemic retinopathy.

We found that intercellular signalling networks can be clustered into modules associated with specific cell subsets, and that biomaterial-specific responses can be characterized by interactions between signalling modules for immune, fibroblast and tissue-specific cells.

The current consensus is that myogenic cells originate from somites, while connective tissue fibroblasts originate from the lateral plate mesoderm. We challenged this model by cell and genetic lineage tracing experiments and identified that a subpopulation of limb myogenic cells did not originate from somite or Pax3 lineage, but rather originated from the lateral plate mesoderm and were derived from Osr1 and Scx lineages. Results: Analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data obtained from limb cells at successive developmental stages identified a subpopulation of cells displaying a dual muscle and connective tissue signature, in addition to independent muscle and connective tissue populations. Active BMP signalling was detected in this junctional cell sub-population and at the tendon/muscle interface in developing limbs. BMP gain- and loss-of-function experiments performed in vivo and in vitro showed that this signalling pathway regulated a fibroblast-to-myoblast conversion. Conclusions: We propose that localised BMP signalling converts a subset of lateral plate mesoderm-derived fibroblasts to a myogenic fate and establishes a boundary of fibroblast-derived myonuclei at the tendon/muscle interface to control the muscle pattern during limb development and myotendinous formation.

However, the rate of re-injury after surgery is relatively high, and collection of autologous tendons leads muscle weakness which results in prolonged rehabilitation. Here, we introduce the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-based technology aiming at developing a new therapeutic option after tendon injury.

Overall design: C57B6 mice received pre-operative treatment with 0.06 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously and were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane inhalation. A 10 mm longitudinal skin incision was made along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon was separated from surrounding tissue and dissected at it's midsection. For the sciatic neurectomy, blunt dissection was performed through the biceps femoris to expose the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve was transected with reflection and suturing of the proximal nerve stump to the nearby semitendinosus muscle to prevent re-innervation.  As a control, sham nerve injuries consisted of surgical exposure of the sciatic nerve without transection. Incisions were sutured closed with 5-0 Vicryl suture. Tenotomy injury site, consisting of tissue from the Achilles' tendon insertion at the gastrocnemius to the distal tendon enthesis at the calcaneus and surrounding tissue, excluding bone and skin, was harvested 7 days after injury. Tissue samples were digested for 20 minutes in 750U/ml Type 1 Collagenase and 7U/ml Dispase II (Gibco) in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at 37°C under constant agitation of 160rpm.

This evolutionary trait has puzzled biologists and consumers, and the molecular basis of IB development remains unclear. The goals of this study are to acquire characteristic single-cell maps of gene expression landscapes and lineages and to elucidate the differentiation trajectory of cell clusters related to IB formation and obtain the key regulated gene of IB formation. Methods: The scRNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The bulk RNA-seq profiles of 60 dpf wild-type zebrafish and 60 dpf runx2b-/- zebrafish were generated, using mirVana™ miRNA ISOlation Kit. The scRNA-seq data were filted and clsutered by the Seurat package. The cell differentiation trajectorie was constructed, using Monocle analysis. Runx2b knockdown was preformed by RNA interference and runx2b was inducted by neuropeptide substance P. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays. The mutant zebrafish lines were constructed, using cripsr cas9 technology.The Phenotypic observation was perfomed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), Alizarin red, masson trichrome staining and mico-CT. The nutritent content was also obtained including fatty acid content and anio acid content. Results: we reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors and defined runx2b as the key rugulated gene of IB formaiton, using cripsr cas9 technology. Conclusions: This study is the first to reveal that teleost fish IBs originate from tendons in the skeletal muscle and that the differentiation trajectory from tendon progenitors to the osteoblast lineage is key for IB formation. Large-scale gene function analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 identified the decisive role of runx2b in IB formation. The loss of runx2b significantly restricted osteoblast differentiation and inhibited IB formation, which potentially provides a basis for breeding strains of fish without IBs to improve the safe consumption and economic value of many aquaculture species and in this way, boost the proportion of fish for the supply of animal protein worldwide (Fig. 6). For this reason, we needed to verify that the content of fatty acid in the runx2b-/- mutant was higher than that in runx2b+/+ fish, as well as the expression of key genes related to IBs in the runx2b-/- and runx2b+/+ strains obtained by scRNA-seq data. This study also provides materials and directions for further study to clarify the specific regulatory mechanism of IB formation and will help to discover more specific genetic resources that can be used for IB trait improvement in fish.

Here, we show through detailed functional and single-cell genomic studies that intrinsic aging of bona fide mouse skeletal stem cells (SSCs) alters bone marrow niche signaling and skews bone and blood lineage differentiation leading to fragile bones that regenerate poorly. Aged SSCs have diminished bone and cartilage forming potential but produce higher frequencies of stromal lineages that express high levels of pro-inflammatory and pro-resorptive cytokines. Single-cell transcriptomic studies reveal a distinct population of SSCs in aged mice that gradually outcompete their younger counterparts in the bone marrow niche. While systemic exposure to a youthful circulation through heterochronic parabiosis reduced local expression of inflammatory cytokines, it did not reverse the diminished osteochondrogenic activity of aged SSCs and was insufficient to improve bone mass and skeletal-healing parameters in aged mice. Hematopoietic reconstitution of aged mice with young hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) also did not improve bone integrity and repair. We find that deficient bone regeneration in aged mice could only be reversed by the local application of a combinatorial treatment that re-activates aged SSCs and simultaneously abates crosstalk to hematopoietic cells favoring an inflammatory milieu. This treatment expanded aged SSC pools, reduced osteoclast activity, and enhanced bone healing to youthful levels. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the complex, multifactorial mechanisms underlying skeletal aging and offer new prospects for rejuvenating the aged skeletal system.

Hindlimb development has historically been studied with lineage tracing of individual genes selected a priori, or at the bulk tissue level, which does not allow for the determination of single cell transcriptional programs yielding mature cell types and tissues. To identify the cellular trajectories of lineage specification during limb bud development, we used single cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the developing murine hindlimb between embryonic days (E)11.5-E18.5.

Current standard of care are not very effective and have side effects, making the search for new treatments urgent. Activin A is a member of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) superfamily, is produced by activated macrophages and other inflammatory cells and signals through activation of canonical SMAD2 and SMAD3 (SMAD2/3) intracellular effectors. Because HO starts with inflammation and because pSMAD2/3 activation is chondrogenic, here we tested whether activin A stimulates HO development. Using standard mouse models of acquired intramuscular and subdermal HO, we found that systemic administration of a neutralizing activin A antibody markedly reduced HO development and bone accumulation. Single-cell RNAseq and developmental trajectories showed that the antibody treatment had sharply reduced the number of Sox9+ skeletal progenitors, many of which also expressed the gene encoding activin A (Inhba), that were recruited to the HO site. In line with the latter finding, gain-of-function assays showed that treatment of progenitors with recombinant activin A enhanced their chondrogenic differentiation and did so through SMAD2/3 signaling, and inclusion of activin A to HO-inducing in vivo implants enhanced HO development. Together, our data reveal that activin A is a critical upstream signaling stimulator of HO in mice and could represent an effective therapeutic target against acquired forms of this pathology in patients.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice.

Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice. These findings will lead to the development of novel in vitro and in situ stem cell therapies for effective skeletal muscle repair. Overall design: Freshly isolated neonatal dermal cells, neonatal dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days, adult dermal cells treated with FR medium for 3 days and freshly isolated adult hindlimb skeletal muscle stromal cells were subjected to single cell RNA sequencing.

Activation of resident stem cells or transplantation of myogenic stem cells can promote muscle regeneration. However, major challenges remain in harvesting sufficient autologous myogenic stem cells and expanding such cells efficiently for muscle regeneration therapies. Here, we identified a chemical cocktail that selectively induced a robust expansion of myogenic stem cells from readily-obtainable dermal cells and from muscle stromal cells. By differential plating and lineage tracing, we showed that Pax7+ cells were the major source for chemical-induced myogenic stem cells (CiMCs). We further performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to characterize the transcriptomic profile of CiMCs and demonstrate a specific expansion of myogenic cells from heterogeneous dermal cell population. Upon transplantation into the injured muscle, CiMCs were efficiently engrafted and improved functional muscle regeneration in both adult and aged mice. In addition, CiMC transplantation rescued muscle function in mice with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Furthermore, an in situ therapeutic modality using this cocktail was developed by loading the chemical cocktail into injectable nanoparticles, which enabled a sustained release of the cocktail in injured muscle and a local expansion of resident satellite cells for muscle regeneration in adult and aged mice.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on macrophages sorted from either a biologic matrix [urinary bladder matrix (UBM)] or synthetic biomaterial [polycaprolactone (PCL)]. Implantation of UBM promotes tissue repair through generation of a tissue environment characterized by a T helper 2 (Th2)/interleukin (IL)–4 immune profile, whereas PCL induces a standard foreign body response characterized by Th17/IL-17 and fibrosis. Unbiased clustering and pseudotime analysis revealed distinct macrophage subsets responsible for antigen presentation, chemoattraction, and phagocytosis, as well as a small population with expression profiles of both dendritic cells and skeletal muscle after UBM implantation. In the PCL tissue environment, we identified a CD9 hi+ IL-36y + macrophage subset that expressed Th17-associated molecules. These macrophages were virtually absent in mice lacking the IL-17 receptor, suggesting that they might be involved in IL-17–dependent immune and autoimmune responses. Identification and comparison of the unique phenotypical and functional macrophage subsets in mouse and human tissue samples suggest broad relevance of the new classification. These distinct macrophage subsets demonstrate previously unrecognized myeloid phenotypes involved in different tissue responses and provide targets for potential therapeutic modulation in tissue repair and pathology. Overall design: Macrophages were sorted from mice quadriceps 1 week after undergoing volumetric muscle loss surgery with treatment of urinary bladder matrix, polycaprolactone, or saline. After sorting, cells were encapsulated using the 10x Chromium single cell RNA sequencing platform. Library prep followed the 10x 3' v2 protocol and were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000.

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on macrophages sorted from either a biologic matrix [urinary bladder matrix (UBM)] or synthetic biomaterial [polycaprolactone (PCL)]. Implantation of UBM promotes tissue repair through generation of a tissue environment characterized by a T helper 2 (Th2)/interleukin (IL)–4 immune profile, whereas PCL induces a standard foreign body response characterized by Th17/IL-17 and fibrosis. Unbiased clustering and pseudotime analysis revealed distinct macrophage subsets responsible for antigen presentation, chemoattraction, and phagocytosis, as well as a small population with expression profiles of both dendritic cells and skeletal muscle after UBM implantation. In the PCL tissue environment, we identified a CD9 hi+ IL-36y + macrophage subset that expressed Th17-associated molecules.
